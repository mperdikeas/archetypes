In this stage (32), I implemented a major extension in the
DBPythonExposer to allow the execution of INSERT / UPDATE
statements.

Major challenges were:
[1] The ReportPrinter will need to catch Python exceptions
    and rollback / commit accordingly.
[2] The interface of the ReportPrinter will need to be changed
    to capture the exception in the execution of the report.
[3] I will need to change the interfaces to report the newly
    handled PyException
[4] I will need to also collect and report in the out-queries
    the statements given to sql_exec
