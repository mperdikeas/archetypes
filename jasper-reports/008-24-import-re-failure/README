I managed in this stage (24) to narrow down the problem
and solve it, too, for a console application by 
zipping the Lib/ folder into jython-2.5.3.jar
as described here:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1252965/distributing-my-python-scripts-as-jars-with-jython

Basically I only did the following:
 cd ~/jython2.5.3/
 cp jython.jar jython-2.5.3-wtLib.jar
 zip -r jython-2.5.3-wtLib.jar Lib/
 cp jython-2.5.3-wtLib.jar ~/archetypes/repo-wide-libs/


( the jython.jar file I originally started working on came from 
  a clean download of Jython 2.5.3 and had an md5sum of:
  33a405a327ee368c55ddf55119c255c4
)


However, although the hackery DID work on the console, it failed to work in 
a web context (mysteriously). Therefore my only hope is to now manulally
append datatime.py at the beginning of my script. I will try that on the
next stage (25).
