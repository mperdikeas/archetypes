In this stage (29), I fixed a bug / wrong feature reported to me by Elias,
namely that the form-provided map of fields does not override the fields
defined in the form. This required:

* implementation and interface changes in mutil.jar, package reportprocessor2
* implementation (but NOT interface changes) in ReportPrinter.java
