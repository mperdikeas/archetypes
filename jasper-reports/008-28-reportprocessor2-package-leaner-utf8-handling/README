In this stage (28), I am building upon stage (26) (skipping step 27 which I
consider closed) to replace the report processor implementation with a new
one (package mutil.reportprocessor2) that uses leaner utf-8 processing.

What I managed to do is to properly convert two scripts into their equivalent
scripts in utf8 encoding (ending in 'utf8.py') and it seems to be working 
nicely with the new reportprocessor2 package.

I then set out to do some regression testing and I asked both Christos
and Dimitris to send my scripts and params.ini files to test. As of this
time only Christos has responded and the scripts he provided appeared to
work flawlessly with the new reportprocessor2 without requiring any 
modifications whatsoever (without even requiring a conversion of the file
to the utf-8 format). But this has led me to believe that the tests
aren't as stringent as they should have been and I now have to implement
the user management application GUI using the code generator so this 
effort (or replacing reportprocessor with reportprocessor2 is abandonded)
DUE TO INSUFFICIENT TIME TO PERFORM PROPER REGRESSION TESTING.
