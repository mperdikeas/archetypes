In this Jasper case (003) I managed to subsume as one of my
archetypes the JasperSoft demo "jasper" which is the first
substantial Jasper report (and is actually using a full
JDBC Connection DataSet despite my different understanding
at the beginning).

I also managed to introduce a HSQLDB at the build and
archetype although the build blocks and I couldn't fully
investigate why the parallelly spawned Java process doesn't
seem to finish.

Points for next stages:
[1] produce all kinds of reports (not just PDF)
[2] make minimal web reporting archetype (that should
    actually be a new jasper-reports case, not just 
    a new stage).
