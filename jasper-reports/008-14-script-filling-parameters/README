In this stage I am trying to create an all-encompassing
jar file. This necessitates changes in the build.xml script
and the merging of lib-runtime and lib folders.

I succeeded, the executable Jar file is produced with:
ant package

However, it is not all-encompassing as Java's jar format
does not allow jars within jars. That's why the 'package'
ANT task also copies the jars the param processor depends on.

Run it with ./params-processor
