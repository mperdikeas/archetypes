In this Jasper case and stage (003#01) I managed to produce
nearly all possible kinds of exports (some seemed too exotic that
I didn't bother to try) but didn't troubleshoot the
blocking thing at the Ant file.

Ideas for next stages:
[1] troubleshoot Ant file blocking thing.
[2] make minimal web reporting archetype (that should
    actually be a new jasper-reports case, not just 
    a new stage).
