In this stage (27) I managed to reproduce the parsing error
in Jython when using the particular offending python script
from stage (26). I also understood why this happens: it has
to do with the limit of 100,000 characters in the current
version of Jython, see:

http://bugs.jython.org/issue1744

this is an open issue at this point, for about a year.

The work-around is to remove all comment lines from the
python scripts I import.
