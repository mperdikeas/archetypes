In this stage (001-01) I have managed to streamline
the Ant build.xml file driving the creation of the PDF
and have demonstrated:
[1] using three separate classpaths (compile classpath,
    jasper compile classpath, runtime classpath)
[2] I have discovered that the "jasper compile" classpath
    is identical to the "compile" classpath and THEREFORE
    there is no dependency between the Jasper jrxml file
    and the Java files driving the report.
[3] The second part of point [2] is further evidenced
    by the "compile-jasper" Ant target not having
    a dependency on the "compile" target.
