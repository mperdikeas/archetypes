In this Jasper case (002) I managed to put together a silly HelloWorld report
and have clarified:

[1] why the following API works:
	JasperExportManager.exportReportToPdfFile("build/reports/HelloWorld.jrprint");
    ... which is it works by creating the exported PDF file next to the *.jprint file
    (there's also another version that can explicitly take a different argument)

[2] what is the role of the JasperPrintManager class (it does the actual printing of
    a physical page - maybe we don't need that).
