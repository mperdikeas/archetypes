This is a trouble-shooting version where I am trying to fix the
following problems:

[1] problem with money types (likely related to the postgresql JDBC driver)
[2] problem with """ foo """  %()
[3] automatically detect parameters in SQL queries
[4] handle blank lines in the script
[5] do not detect parameters in comments
