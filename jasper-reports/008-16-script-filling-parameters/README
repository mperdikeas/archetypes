This is a trouble-shooting version where I managed to diagnose the
following problems:

[1] problem with money types (likely related to the postgresql JDBC driver)
[2] problem with """ foo """  %()

About problem [1], it turns out there's nothing we can do. It is a bug
in the JDBC postgresql driver for the Money type.
Problem [2] is not a real problem. It was triggered by the presence
of percentage characters ('%') in the SQL query.

Ideas for future versions:
[1] automatically detect parameters in SQL queries
[2] handle blank lines in the script
[3] do not detect parameters in comments
[4]
