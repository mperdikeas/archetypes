Provenance:
    ../script-that-knows-where-it-lives    

We established in the provenance the utility of the following one-liner:
    ${BASH_SOURCE[0]/%${me}/.}

The above one liner allows a script to access the contents of a file located relative
to it (refer to the README found in that location). It was also demonstrated that the
script could also be accessed through a symlinked directory. There is however a twist:
directory links that lead to the script will work, but the script itself cannot be
symlinked.

For the script to work even if it itself symlinked a multi-line solution is necessary
as shown in the script:
    location-a/where-am-I.sh

(source: http://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/274677)

To verify try call the script:

[a] either directly:
    ./location-a/where-am-I.sh 
    ... in which case both methods work

[b] either through a **directory** symlink (but the final script file is not symlinked):
    ./location-b/location-a/where-am-I.sh 
    ... in which case, again, both methods work

[c] or, upping the ante, via a convoluted chain of scripts:
    ./location-b/b/c/d/e/f/g/h/where-am-I.sh
    ... in which case only the multiliner works
