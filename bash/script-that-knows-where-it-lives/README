The script is found in:

./location-a/where-am-I.sh

To verify that it works invoke it with:

./location-a/where-am-I.sh

You can view the difference (in the second results) by doing a:

cd location-a && ./where-am-I.sh ; cd -


The technique used is apparently symlink-safe as can be verified by doing a:

./location-a-link/where-am-I.sh

... which demonstrates that the method also works.
