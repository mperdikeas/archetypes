In this stage (JAX-RS # 000 # 01) I am trying
to reproduce the work done in (JAX-RS # 000 # 00) only
this time using the Jersey implementation of JAX-RS
and trying to deploy it to JBoss. This 
means that I will have to circumvent the following issue:

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-3199

which originally blocked the (JAX-RS # 000 # 00) stage and led
to its implementation using resteasy.

* Outcome:

I managed to circumvent the above problem by disabling resteasy.scan
in web.xml according to the instructions given here:

(answer by Anthony Dahanne). However, I then stumbled upon the following
problem which seems unresolved for the moment:
