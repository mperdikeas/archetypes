This is totally WIP I have to finish the experimentation with setting a SSO cookie
for specific application partitions.

Also, I believe that the following example:

    ~/playground/cookies/004-custom-cookie-common-source-of-sso-values-full-example/

... now offers a more complete archetype (even though it's in the "playground" repo).
