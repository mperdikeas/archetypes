This is an attempt to build a bare-bones JSP Model 2 application
(see http://mperdikeas.github.io/struts-1.1/res_rep.pdf).

This has been tested against Apache Tomcat 7.0.26.0

It uses both forward and redirect (from page to page) to
exemplify the correct functioning of both.

The code is entirely mine.

This episode differs from the previous one in the following ways:
[1] it ditches URL rewriting
[2] implements access control in the AuthenticationFilter

Ideas for new interesting features:

[1] add timer that shows how much time's left in the session
[2] add [back] button.

In the next version I should implement everything with redirects
so feature [2] is supported out of the box.


This appliation can be accessed at:

    http://localhost:8080/<context-path>/controller/login
