Invoking the ant and trying to use the wsconsume Ant task here
fails with:

    Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/jboss/wsf/spi/tools/WSContractConsumerFactory

(haven't solved this yet)

Actually, reading the JBoss EAP6 Development Guide ([1]) it appears that only the
command-line wsconsume tool is supported.
