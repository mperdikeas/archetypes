In this example I managed to deploy a reasteasy-based class
that exposes a REST API. The package and project names
starting with 'jersey' are a misnomer as I am using
JBoss's resteasy and not jersey. I originally set out
to do with jersey but I stumbled upon the following issue:

https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-3199

, and so it seems that I cannot bundly jersey or use the jersey
configurations in web.xml when I deploy REST web services to 
JBoss AS. Instead, I have to rely on resteasy which is provided
by JBoss.

The deployed REST web service (only a parameterless GET at the moment)
is available at:
