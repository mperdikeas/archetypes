Experimenting with Not Nulls

In this use case (JPA # 000) and stage (14)
I am experimenting with removing detached
entities.

Findings are:

[1] detached entities cannot be removed.
[2] entities found (therfore initially managed) and then detached
    cannot be removed (same as 1).
[3] getEntityManagerFactory().getCache().evictAll() does not
    cause the EntityManager to go back to the database for
    removed rows.
[4] but clear() does.
