Experimenting with Master-Detail

In this use case (JPA # 001)
I am experimenting with master-detail forms
in a wizzard-like flow of steps to try
and reproduced detached entity exception
and see how I can solve them.

In this stage (02) I am implementing the 'edit'
functionality.

Issues for future stages:
[1] implement lazy loading
[2] implement tentative modifications (with undo)
