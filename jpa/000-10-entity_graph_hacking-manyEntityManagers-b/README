Experimenting with JPA eager / lazy loading.

In this use case (JPA # 000) and stage (10)
I experimented with many EntityManagers.
(Apress.JPA.2 book pg. 22).

Conclusion: A single instance **per persistent entity
manager** is created. If more than one entity
managers are used (say N) you can observe from the distribution
of the hashcodes that N instances per persistent entity,
in total, are created.


Things for future stages:

(a) experiment more with merges and such...
(b) implement a framework for tentative changes
(c) implement facades
(d) check the extent to which the above carry onto
    proper web applications.
