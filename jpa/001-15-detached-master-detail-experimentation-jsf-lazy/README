Experimenting with Master-Detail

In this use case (JPA # 001) I am experimenting
with master-detail forms in a wizzard-like
flow of steps to try and reproduced detached
entity exception and see how I can solve them.

In this stage (15), which draws its provenance
from stage (12), I am implementing lazy-loading
operations. I am also reverting back to the
simpler child removal approach (without using
EntityManager#remove on the child).

Issues for future stages:

[1] implement tentative modifications (with undo) - if necessary
    cause maybe the POJO space of the EntityManager offers the cache
    we need.
