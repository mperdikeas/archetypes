Experimenting with JPA eager / lazy loading.

In this use case (JPA # 000) and stage (09)
I am experimenting with many EntityManagers.
(Apress.JPA.2 book pg. 22)

Things for future stages:

(a) experiment more with merges and such...
(b) implement a framework for tentative changes
(c) implement facades
(d) check the extent to which the above carry onto
    proper web applications.
