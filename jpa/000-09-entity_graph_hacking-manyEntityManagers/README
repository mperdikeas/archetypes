Experimenting with JPA eager / lazy loading.

In this use case (JPA # 000) and stage (09)
I experimented with EntityManagers.
(Apress.JPA.2 book pg. 22).

Conclusion: only a single instance per persistent entity
is created, at least when one EntityManager
is used. As a result the 1st fetch takes about 200 times
longer than the subsequent fetches.

Things for future stages:

(a) experiment with many EntityManagers
(a) experiment more with merges and such...
(b) implement a framework for tentative changes
(c) implement facades
(d) check the extent to which the above carry onto
    proper web applications.
