Experimenting with Master-Detail

In this use case (JPA # 001) I am experimenting
with master-detail forms in a wizzard-like
flow of steps to try and reproduced detached
entity exception and see how I can solve them.

In this stage (12), which draws its provenance
from stage (11), I am trying to dig a little
deeper.

Issues for future stages:

[1] keep investigating, or maybe revert to iBatis.

[2] implement lazy loading

[3] implement tentative modifications (with undo).
