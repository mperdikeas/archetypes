Experimenting with Master-Detail

In this use case (JPA # 001)
I am experimenting with master-detail forms
in a wizzard-like flow of steps to try
and reproduced detached entity exception
and see how I can solve them.

In this stage (07) I managed to solve the
ConcurrentModification bug that I discovered in stage (06)
and I can now remove top (A) entities, with their corresponding
graphs. However, I also found out that now
I can't get the EntityManager::remove
method to work for the child (B) entities. See the comments
in ABLController.java. The first delete button that deletes by
modifying the collection works, but not the second.

Issues for future stages:

[1] implement lazy loading

[2] implement tentative modifications (with undo).
