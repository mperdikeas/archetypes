Experimenting with Master-Detail

In this use case (JPA # 001) and stage (01)
I am experimenting with master-detail forms
in a wizzard-like flow of steps to try
and reproduced detached entity exception
and see how I can solve them.

Issues for future stages:
[1] implement edit
[2] implement lazy loading
[3] implement tentative modifications (with undo)
