Experimenting with JPA eager / lazy loading.

In this use case (JPA # 000) and stage (04) I 
managed to implement a pattern for master-detail
JPA collections and their removal, requiring, 
on the client side only two calls:

 (i) one to the EntityManager::remove
(ii) one to nullify the father reference in the
     detail bean (which in turn triggers a removal
     from the father's collection).

Things to do for future stages:
(a) implement the pattern to pre-hook the nullification
    in the entity code.
(b) check the extent to which the above carry onto
    proper web applications.
