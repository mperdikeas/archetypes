Experimenting with Master-Detail

In this use case (JPA # 001) I am experimenting
with master-detail forms in a wizzard-like
flow of steps to try and reproduced detached
entity exception and see how I can solve them.

In this stage (09) I tried and succeeded to 
narrowdown stage (08) in a console application.
I also discovered all possible combinations that
allow one to remove child entities.

See the boolean matrix in Test.java:line-37
for the results of the findings.

Issues for future stages:

[0] narrow it down even further so I can send it to SO

[1] try to reproduce the inability to use EntityManager::remove
    on the child entity, in a console context (so I can SO-post it).

[2] implement lazy loading

[3] implement tentative modifications (with undo).
