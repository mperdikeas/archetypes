Experimenting with JPA eager / lazy loading.

In this use case (JPA # 000) and stage (07)
I was trying to see what happens when 
an entity is removed from a collection in 
the master table and then brought back
to life through a separate 'find' in the
same transaction.

The findings seem to indicate that finding an
entity 'b' through the EntityManager (em), and even
doing an 'em.persist(b)' and 'em.merge(b)' has
no effect when the entity has previously been
removed. Things are rather hairy though.

Things to do for future stages:
(a) experiment more with a 'find,change,merge' cycle.
(b) implement a framework for tentative changes
(c) implement facades
(d) check the extent to which the above carry onto
    proper web applications.
