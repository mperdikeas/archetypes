Experimenting with Not Nulls

In this use case (JPA # 000) and stage (12)
I am building on the work of stage (11) 
to try to trigger a failure due to the
NotNull characteristics (in database
and JPA annotations in the entity bean).

There were two important findings:
[1] nullifying the parent reference (as in Test.java:line62)
    is enough to also remove the child entity from the
    database (I suspect this is happening because the B entity
    is still managed at that point).

[2] the vanilla nullifying of the A reference in the B entity
    fails (predictably), but strangly, despite all the
    different permutations I 've tried (as in B.java:line39
    and line41), the exact same stack exception is triggered.

things for future stages:
[1] create a narrowed down version of the inability to trigger
    different stack traces.
