Experimenting with JPA eager / lazy loading.

In this use case (JPA # 000) and stage (06)
I managed to implement two hooks for child
removal in master-detail Entity relationships.

One, that uses the @PreRemove hook in the
detail entity (B) and another that uses
the DELETE_ORPHAN cascade hibernate annotation
in the master entity (A).

In this way the children removal works both
when a child 'b' is removed with the em.remove(b)
method as well as when it is simply removed from the
Bs collection at A.

Things to do for future stages:
(a) check the extent to which the above carry onto
    proper web applications.
