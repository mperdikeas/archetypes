Experimenting with Master-Detail

In this use case (JPA # 001) I am experimenting
with master-detail forms in a wizzard-like
flow of steps to try and reproduced detached
entity exception and see how I can solve them.

In this stage (11), which draws its provenance
from stage (08), I am trying to reach a conclusion
regarding the inability to do a plain EntityManager::remove
for child rows based on the findings of stages (09) and
(10).

See the comments in ABLController.java:line-117.
I 've changed numerous methods (even in BFacade) but
failed to reach any conclusive answers.

The only tentative conclusion is that it appears that
the only 'safe' way to remove a child entity is to 
null-out its references and merge its father entity.
In particular, I was unable to do an EntityManager::remove()
on the child entity, even if the references were nulled out.
I think this is different than in the case of the console
application.

The first delete button that deletes by
modifying the collection works, but not the second.

Issues for future stages:

[1] keep investigating, or maybe revert to iBatis.

[2] implement lazy loading

[3] implement tentative modifications (with undo).
