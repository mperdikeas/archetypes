Experimenting with Master-Detail

In this use case (JPA # 001)
I am experimenting with master-detail forms
in a wizzard-like flow of steps to try
and reproduced detached entity exception
and see how I can solve them.

In this stage (04) I managed to implement
removal in two separate ways: JPA-way and 
EntityManager-way.

Issues for future stages:

[1] implement selection based on the new identity hash to 
    see whether it works.

[2] implement removal of top (A) entities
    with their corresponding graph

[3] implement lazy loading

[4] implement tentative modifications (with undo)
