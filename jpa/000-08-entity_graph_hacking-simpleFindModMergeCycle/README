Experimenting with JPA eager / lazy loading.

In this use case (JPA # 000) and stage (08)
I aim to experiment more with a 'find,change,merge' cycle.

Things for future stages:

(a) implement a framework for tentative changes
(b) implement facades
(c) check the extent to which the above carry onto
    proper web applications.
