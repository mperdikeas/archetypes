Experimenting with JPA eager / lazy loading.

In this use case (JPA # 000) and stage (08)
I experimented more with a 'find,change,merge' cycle.

Looking at the unique hashcodes
printed and the calls to B's constructor, it becomes evident
that the EntityManager maintains internal references to 
objects. Also, and perhaps more surprisingly,
EntityManager::remov-ing an object changes subsequent
finds.

Things for future stages:

(a) experiment more with merges and such...
(b) implement a framework for tentative changes
(c) implement facades
(d) check the extent to which the above carry onto
    proper web applications.
