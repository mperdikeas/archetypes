Experimenting with Master-Detail

In this use case (JPA # 001)
I am experimenting with master-detail forms
in a wizzard-like flow of steps to try
and reproduced detached entity exception
and see how I can solve them.

In this stage (05) I am trying to:


[1] implement selection based on the new identity hash to 
    see whether it works. Experiment with what happens
    if the hash fails.

Issues for future stages:

[1] implement removal of top (A) entities
    with their corresponding graph

[2] implement lazy loading

[3] implement tentative modifications (with undo)
