Experimenting with Master-Detail

In this use case (JPA # 001)
I am experimenting with master-detail forms
in a wizzard-like flow of steps to try
and reproduced detached entity exception
and see how I can solve them.

In this stage (06) I managed to capture
a ConcurrentModification bug that was prompted
by the @PreRemoval hook in my removal pattern.
I know the answer (remove the hook) but I am 
keeping the stage as the bug's cage.

Issues for future stages:

[1] implement removal of top (A) entities
    with their corresponding graph

[2] implement lazy loading

[3] implement tentative modifications (with undo)
