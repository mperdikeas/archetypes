Experimenting with Master-Detail

In this use case (JPA # 001)
I am experimenting with master-detail forms
in a wizzard-like flow of steps to try
and reproduced detached entity exception
and see how I can solve them.

In this stage (02) I managed to implement the 'edit'
functionality and reproduce the 'detached-entity-exception'.

Issues for future stages:
[1] solve the 'detached-entity-exception' using extended
    persistent context and SFSB.
[2] implement lazy loading
[3] implement tentative modifications (with undo)
