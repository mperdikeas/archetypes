This use case stage (JPA # 001 # 13) which draws its provenance
from (JPA # 001 # 10) was inspired by the
efforts of (JPA # 001 # 11) and (JPA # 001 # 12) with the object
of reproducing some merge scenarios in a console-based application
to examine what happens during merge.
The way to test the application is to run it and modify the
database (in parallel) during the pauses.

The findings are consistent with the theory developed in (JPA # 001 # 12)
in that, indeed, during the merge of B, the many-to-one relationship
aId that points to the A entity is also navigated and the object A
is re-read from the database. This may result in additional or
fewer Bs being fetched in the new, managed A entity depending on what
was done to the database. I should also experiment on what happens
when the entities A and B and not detached.
