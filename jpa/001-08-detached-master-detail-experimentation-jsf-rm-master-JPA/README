Experimenting with Master-Detail

In this use case (JPA # 001) I am experimenting
with master-detail forms in a wizzard-like
flow of steps to try and reproduced detached
entity exception and see how I can solve them.

In this stage (08) I reproduce the state at the
end of stage (07) but by specifying
the JPA orphan removal method so as to remove
Hibernate dependency. This is the baseline
from now on so we are JPA-compliant.

The problem however with the inability to remove child rows
using plain EntityManager::remove remains.

See the comments in ABLController.java:line-117.

The first delete button that deletes by
modifying the collection works, but not the second.

Issues for future stages:

[1] try to reproduce the inability to use EntityManager::remove
    on the child entity, in a console context (so I can SO-post it).

[2] implement lazy loading

[3] implement tentative modifications (with undo).
