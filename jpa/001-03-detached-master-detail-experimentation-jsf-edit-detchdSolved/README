Experimenting with Master-Detail

In this use case (JPA # 001)
I am experimenting with master-detail forms
in a wizzard-like flow of steps to try
and reproduced detached entity exception
and see how I can solve them.

In this stage (03) I am managed to solve the
'detached-entity-exception' showcased in stage 02
not by using extended persistence context and
SBSB but by merging the entity.

Issues for future stages:
[1] implement lazy loading
[2] implement tentative modifications (with undo)
