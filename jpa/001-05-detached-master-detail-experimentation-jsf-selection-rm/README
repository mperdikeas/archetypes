Experimenting with Master-Detail

In this use case (JPA # 001)
I am experimenting with master-detail forms
in a wizzard-like flow of steps to try
and reproduced detached entity exception
and see how I can solve them.

In this stage (05) I managed to implement selection
based on the new identity hash to 
see whether it works.

Strangely, when the hash code utility fails, the
delete logic still works and one is still able to select
the row in question.

Issues for future stages:

[1] implement removal of top (A) entities
    with their corresponding graph

[2] implement lazy loading

[3] implement tentative modifications (with undo)
