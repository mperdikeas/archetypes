Experimenting with Not Nulls

In this use case (JPA # 000) and stage (01)
(which draws its provenance from JPA # 000 # 08)
I am experimenting with the existence of NotNull
characteristics either in the JPA annotation
or in the database itself. I discovered
(despite what GDimitriades had told me)
that both methods of removal work even when the
column in the database is set to 'NOT NULL', and
moreover, even when the entity is annotated
with a JPA 'not null' annotation.

What's even more bizzare is that a field 
may be described as 'not null' in the JPA
entity annotations, and yet it can be set to 
null (apparently, the entity manager only
checks for nullness upon commit ?) (see A.java
 - line 41).


Things for future stages:
