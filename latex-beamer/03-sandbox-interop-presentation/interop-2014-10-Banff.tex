% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item developed new Java-based curation library for IVOA services (SCS, SIA and SSA)
    \item library does not require user to input values for service parameters (e.g. right ascension, declination or search radius) so its suitable for automated tests that lack a human to provide reasonable values.
    \item only requires type of service and access URL of service
    \item as such can be exposed as a rest-web service:
    \vfill
    \tiny{\texttt{http://10.66.180.5//sval/[type-of-service]?accessURL=[accessURL]}}
