In this use case I managed to implement a fully-functional
interface to memcached that's supporting Shiro's CacheManager and Cache
interfaces. Next steps could be to:

(a) try it with composite types to make sure that memcached serialization 
    plays nicely.
(b) understand the import of all those K, V and how exactly is genericity
    used in this project.
(c) try it as a drop-on replacement to Shiro's default cache manager.
