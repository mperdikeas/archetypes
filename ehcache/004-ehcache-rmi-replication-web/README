In this use case I am trying to setup a small example using
EhCache on a web application (no Shiro yet). The method
to achieve replication is not a Terracotta server array
but rather EhCache RMI replication.

NB: the name terracotta that appears in the folders, deployment
artefacts and the application's context is a misnomer.
I don't have the luxury to worry about this right now.
