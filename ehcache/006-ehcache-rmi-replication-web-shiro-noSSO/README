In this use case I managed to combine Shiro with EhCache 
with Shiro using the JdbcRealm, independently from EhCache and
having both applications share the same Database but with no 
SSO functionality yet.

Note: some of the navigation logic and options is sub-standard 
but I don't have the time to fix that just now.
Also, the name 'terracotta' is a misnomer (no terracotta is involved)
but I don't have the time to fix that either.

Next, and hopefully final step would be to implement SSO with Shiro
using EhCache.
