(see the README in usecase '007-ehcache-rmi-replication-web-shiro-SSO' to
 understand the context).

In this sub-stage I MANAGED to solve the problem of EHCACHE USECASE 007
by replacing the non-static Logger members in my backing beans with
static Logger members. And while I'm at it, I also made User serializable
so that all JSF-backing beans are serializable and that I don't
see any more non-serializable exceptions on the console output of JBoss AS.

This SUB-STAGE 'c' concludes the USE CASE 007 (SUB-STAGE 'b' is now obsolete
and will not be further investigated since I solved the issue).

The answer regarding the problem was provided here:
