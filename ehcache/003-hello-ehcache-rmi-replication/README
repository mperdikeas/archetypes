This is a very simple use case showing
two ehcaches being synchronized without
using Terracotta Server Array at the back,
just EhCache replication with RMI.
I've also built upon the previous foundation
and now the user is prompted to add a translation
in the cache is the word is not found, and the word
becomes immediately available to the other cache 
as well.
