In this use case I am trying to expand upon the
previous example of using EhCache on a web application (no Shiro yet) using
RMI replication (no Terracotta server array).
The difference in this use case is that I plan to deploy on different paths
so as to test that tabbed browsing of different applications is possible.

NB: the name terracotta that appears in the folders, deployment
artefacts and the application's context is a misnomer.
I don't have the luxury to worry about this right now.
