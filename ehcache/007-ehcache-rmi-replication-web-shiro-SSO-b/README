****************************************************************

In this Use Case I am frantically trying to solve the instability of Use Case 7
by modifying EhCache source code to replace logging with System.out.printlns
(hence, the file "ehcache-core-2.7.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" one sees in the libs of
this Use Case is produced by my own modified EhCache sources).

But apparently this strategy is failing so I am left with three options:

[  i] try to troubleshoot JBoss AS logging problem with renewed vigor
      as this is now where the crux of the matter lies.

[ ii] modify JBoss AS sources instead and solve the logging problem there.

[iii] drop the EhCache approach and implement my own Shiro Cache Manager
      using MemCache.
