You should make sure that the IP address configured in 
file "jboss-ejb-client.properties" is the same as the
one that JBoss AS 7.1 binds to.

This is configured in file: <jboss-root>/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml.

E.g. a typical section might read as follows:

    <interfaces>
        <interface name="management">
            <inet-address value="${jboss.bind.address.management:127.0.0.1}"/>
        </interface>
        <interface name="public">
            <inet-address value="${jboss.bind.address:127.0.0.1}"/>
        </interface>
        (...)
    <interfaces>

The meaning of the above is that JBoss AS 7.1.1 will bind to 127.0.0.1
unless the jboss.bind.address environment property is defined, in which
case it will bind to the value of that.
So if JBoss is started with the "standalone.sh" script without defining this
property, it will bind to 127.0.0.1. If on the other hand it is started
like this:

./standalone.sh -Djboss.bind.address=172.31.129.29 -bmanagement=127.0.0.1

It will bind to 172.31.129.29. Then, the value of the property
"remote.connection.default.host" defined in the "jboss-ejb-client.properties"
file will have to change accordingly.
(this wasted 8 hours of my time on 9.VIII.2012).
