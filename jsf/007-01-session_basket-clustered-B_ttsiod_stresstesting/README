In this use case (007) stage (01), and sub-stage (B) I am trying
to utilize ttsiod's python script (test-baskets.py) for stress-testing
to verify the stability of session clustering.

To run the script you have to:
    (1) install twill (sudo apt-get install python-twill)
    (2) deploy the EAR artefact to the 'deployments' location of the
        two JBoss AS instances.
    (3) make sure the script is collocated with the launch scripts it calls
        in line 44.
    (4) make sure the nginx front-end is up and running and properly configured
        (I've kept a copy of the nginx.conf here - it's supposed to go to: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf)

Common causes of problems:
[1] nginx misconfiguration
[2] launch script names are different
[3] EAR artefact has not been deployed

Also, JBoss complains at some point for some network settings.
That's why its advisable you do the following before starting the tests:

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
sudo sysctl net.core.rmem_max=31457280
sudo sysctl net.core.wmem_max=1048576
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
