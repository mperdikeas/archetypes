I created two new virtual interfaces using:
$ sudo ifconfig eth0:1 172.31.129.200
$ sudo ifconfig eth0:2 172.31.129.201

In this folder I also keep the nginx.conf files I used
before (no VIPs) and after (two new VIPs) the change
as well as the JBoss AS71.1.1 launch scripts (both before
and after the change).

The result of the test was that nginx* and clustering 
works just fine with virtual IP addresses.
