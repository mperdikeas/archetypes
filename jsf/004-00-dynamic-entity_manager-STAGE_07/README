In this STAGE (07) we managed to also modify (edit) AND
remove the entity beans from different databases.
A problem I seem to be having (but unrelated to the main point of 
this exercise which was to handled different databases) is that
both "edit" and "remove" functionality on the second form don't
seem to be working on the 1st try.
