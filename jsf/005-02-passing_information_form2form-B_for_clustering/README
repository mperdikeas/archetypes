In this stage (which is initiated after the TERMINAL of JSF # 005 # 02)
I am did manage to deploy an EAR application in a clustered environment 
of 2 JBoss AS7.1.1. servers by fronting it with an nginx server.
(I've kep the nginx.conf file as a reference - it goes in /etc/nginx).

It turned out that I did ofcourse had to add the <distributable/> inside
<web-app> in web.xml (I verified that it wouldn't distribute in the cluster
otherwise), but that wasn't all. I also discovered that passing information
with the Flash object can't be done with a redirect when the JBoss AS7.1.1.
uses the standalone-ha.xml configuration. See more here:

Other than those two changes above and some immaterial logging 
there is no other difference between the code of this sub-stage (005-02/B)
and that of the original stage (005-02).

The code in this example appeared to be unreliable but this is in fact not
so and I am now happy to terminate this sub-stage. The instances of unreliability
were on account of two things:
[1] At one point I launched three servers in the cluster, two of which had the
    same name and that apparently unbalanced the cluster.
[2] Occassionally, when very aggresive reloading is used and as the user session
    bounces from server to server, I get the following trace:

   which is an open acknowledged bug in JBoss AS (AS7-4260) (see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AS7-4260)
   and for which, there's nothing I can do.


Things to consider for the future:
[1] how to instruct nginx to not do round-robin but have sticky sessions
    and use the other server in the cluster only in the case of failures.
    Maybe that'll improve performance and also reduce instances of 'Exception
    acquiring ownership'.
