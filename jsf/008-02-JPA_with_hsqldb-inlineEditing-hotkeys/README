In this use case (008) and stage (02) I 
am tried and failed to use <p:hotkey> to bind the ARROW_UP and
ARROW_DOWN keys to a change in the selected row in the
datatable.

The reason being that, for the ARROW_UP and ARROW_DOWN keys to work,
the form shouldn't have received focus in any of the
input elements. On the other hand, for the F3 key to 
work (insert a new row), the form *needs* to have 
received focus.

So I settled with various other improvements.
