In this USE CASE (008) and STAGE (02) I 
am tried and failed to use <p:hotkey> to bind the ARROW_UP and
ARROW_DOWN keys to a change in the selected row in the
datatable.

The reason being that, for the ARROW_UP and ARROW_DOWN keys to work,
the form shouldn't have received focus in any of the
input elements. On the other hand, for the F3 key to 
work (insert a new row), the form *needs* to have 
received focus.

So I settled with various other improvements and generally adopted
the practice to bind the Function keys and the ESC key to the 'html'
tag directly, using JavaScript.

There is no more room for improvement in this STAGE without fundamentally
altering its character.

In a possible, future STAGE I should aim to implement the proper placement
of focus in the form's input text boxes in response to the user's arrow
key events.
