In this STAGE (05) we are able to bind to the EJB3 bean
using a deployment structured in three parts:

[1] Users-client.jar
[2] Users-ejb.ear (contains only only module: Users-ejb.jar and the Users-client.jar as a library)
[3] Users-war.war (contains Users-client.jar as a library)

Where the Users-client.jar is not deployed independently
and where there exists only one persistence.xml file
declared in the Users-ejb.jar that's contained inside 
Users-ejb.ear.
