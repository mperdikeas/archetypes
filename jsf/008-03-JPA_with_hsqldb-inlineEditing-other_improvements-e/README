In this USE CASE (008), STAGE (03) and SUB-STAGE (e) I 
am trying to implement additional functinality on top of
sub-stage (d):

[a] verify that the javascript code works in the presence of more than 1 child types
[b] verify that the javascript code can be extended to more than 2 levels of depth.
    I.e. not just father-child, but father-child-grandchild
[c] implement (for intellectual curiosity mostly) the tentative delete functionality
[d] merge G. Dimitriadis changes in script.js
[e] store script.js as part of the repo.
