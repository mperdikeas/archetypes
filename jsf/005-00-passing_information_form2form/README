In this stage we are showcasing the following:
[1] a mechanism for passing information from bean to bean using
    @ManagedProperty injection from the CustomerLController to the CustomerEController
[2] use of the faces redirect option where it is shown that every second attempt
    to open the 2nd page for viewing the user fails (as faces redirect destroys the 
    request-scoped beans)
[3] we are demonstrating that the ViewScope is NOT broader than the RequestScope as
    if one tries to change the scope of the 2nd bean to ViewScoped the passing of
    information from CustomerLController to CustomerEController fails whether or
    not redirect is applied. This is due to the change of view from the first page
    to the second and can be observed by noticing the output of the logging messages
    emitted in the UserEController class (methods 'getTheEdited' and 'setTheEdited')
    where the instance of the bean is also showed. It can then be seen in the output
    of the application server that #setTheEdited is called on a DIFFERENT instance
    than #getTheEdited when the scope of the UserEController bean is "ViewScoped"
    but called on the SAME instance when the scope is "RequestScoped".
problems:
[1] since the 2nd bean is request-scoped the "save" button doesn't exist when 
    trying to save the changes (the backing bean's 'theUser' field is set to null).
