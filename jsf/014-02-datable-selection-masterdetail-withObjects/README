In this use case I managed to demonstrate that the
problem captured in JSF use case XXX-02 is not JPA-related
but rather JSF or even Prime Faces-related. It may not 
even necessarily be a problem. It is quite likely that this
behaviour is a feature or something I don't yet understand.

This project links with EJB and JPA jars but this is so only
because I didn't have the time to clean-up extra,
un-needed dependencies.

In reality, the code is pure-SE Java (except for the JSF part).

To see the failure toggle the scope annotation in line 37 of
class NumbersController between ViewScoped and RequestScoped
and watch the logging messages in the JBoss AS console.

When set to Request Scope, the selected divisor logging message
(at line 66) prints '0', i.e. fails to obtain it properly.
