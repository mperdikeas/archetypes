In this stage I should aim to showcase the following:
[1] passing of information using the flush on an identifier
    instead of the entity bean (should be the same)
[2] "add" button to create a new entity
[3] establish the limitations of the @ManagedProperty
    pattern as the 2nd bean would have to be of Request scope
    to survive the transition to the new view, and yet, of
    View scope to survive save / edits on the second page
    and one can't have both (unless perhaps a separate "view" bean
    is used for that, i.e. one "request" bean to carry the value
    and a second "view" bean perhaps obtained from the first or
    copied to hold it).
