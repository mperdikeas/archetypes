In this stage we are showcase the following:
[1] passing of information using the flush on an identifier
    instead of the entity bean (should be the same)
[2] "add" button to create a new entity

Ideas for work in future stages:

[1] establish the limitations of the @ManagedProperty
    pattern as the 2nd bean would have to be of Request scope
    to survive the transition to the new view, and yet, of
    View scope to survive save / edits on the second page
    and one can't have both (unless perhaps a separate "view" bean
    is used for that, i.e. one "request" bean to carry the value
    and a second "view" bean perhaps obtained from the first or
    copied to hold it).
[2] experiment to try and identify the impact (if any) of the
    [ajax="false"] attribute setting in the <p:commandButton>
[3] include an option to cancel the creation on the second page.
