This is a very interesting bug case that wasted more than 8 hours
of my time on 16 and 17-X-2012. It seemed as though it was related
to a JPA bug, but apparently it was nothing of that kind. It was
related to backing-bean scope: having the scope set to View highlights
the bug whereas setting the scope to Request solves the issue.
This is noteworthy as it is the first instance that I've encountered
where broadening the scope causes trouble. It has up until now been
the case that narrowing, not broadening the scope caused trouble.

Anyway it appears that JSF somehow caches the detail information 
retrieved when scope is set to View and never updates it when 
the new "current" of type Car is fetched (with its Collection<CarInfo>).
When scope is set to Request there is no such problem.

Note also, that interestingly, in either case, the setter for the
second detail table is never called.

To see the bug toggle the scope in line 42 of CarsCELVController.java
between 'Request' and 'View' and see what happens on the detail table
when another master table row is selected and the 'updateDetail' button
is clicked.

The provenance of this bug case comes from case:
'008-03-JPA_with_hsqldb-inlineEditing-other_improvements-d'

as seen on commit:
'commit 3d45f3e'
