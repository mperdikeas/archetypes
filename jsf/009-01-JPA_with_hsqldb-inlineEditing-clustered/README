In this use case (009) and stage (01) we are trying to 
see whether JBoss AS clustering works when 
the web application also uses a database in the background.
In this first stage, a simple HSQLDB is used. At the next
stage I should perhaps change that to a PostgreSQL for
added realism.

Conclusion: ttsiodras ran some tests with both HsqlDB and PostgreSQL
and in both cases JBoss AS clustering works but we have some stability
problems.

Executive summary of results: the fall of one node doesn't impact
operations, but re-starting the fallen warrior can lead to a
number of problems:

-  freezes of 15-20 sec (i.e. both app servers are frozen),
   after which things proceed OK
-  freezes of 15-20 sec (i.e. both app servers are frozen),
   after which my test script gets a 404 - and aborts

The frequency of each result depends on whether you run both locally or not
the problem areas are far more frequent when both appservers are in the same machine
but 404s happen anyway - their probability is not zero, not even in two-machine config.

The two JBoss AS instances were clustered according to the instructions found
here:

https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/AS7+Cluster+Howto

The above link is a more "manual" way of configuring JBoss AS clustering
and thus, presumably, more stable than the default multicasting groups
method but the results were the same.
