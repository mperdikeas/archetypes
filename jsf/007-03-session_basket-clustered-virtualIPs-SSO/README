In this use case (007) and stage (03) I am trying to
expand upon the previous stage (02) by implementing 
a Shiro-based SSO solution on top of the previous
JBoss-clustered solution.

I am trying to gauge whether there may be any conflict
with the Shiro-based sessions used as part of the SSO
solution (when implemented using a distributed EhCache
or my own MemCached driver).

However, I couldn't proceed any farther due to a bug
in the community edition of JBoss (7.1.1) that's only
fixed in the EAP edition (7.1.3). Bottom line is that
this kind of exploration cannot proceed without a 
proper subscription to the real product.
