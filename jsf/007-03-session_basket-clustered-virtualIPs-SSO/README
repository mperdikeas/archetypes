In this use case (007) and stage (03) I am trying to
expand upon the previous stage (02) by implementing 
a Shiro-based SSO solution on top of the previous
JBoss-clustered solution.

I am trying to gauge whether there may be any conflict
with the Shiro-based sessions used as part of the SSO
solution (when implemented using a distributed EhCache
or my own MemCached driver).
