In this USE CASE (008) and STAGE (03) I am trying to 
implement some miscellaneous, usability improvements 
on the status of the previous STAGE (02).
Mostly adding a new row *below* the current one
and tracking the selected row with the cursor.

Final conclusion: I confirmed with GD that <p:inputText>
doesn't work with filtering. Did some minor maintenance work
and decided to close this STAGE. In the next STAGE I should
experiment with the p:sheet since it appears to be more
appropriate for the keyboard-heavy functionality I am looking at.
