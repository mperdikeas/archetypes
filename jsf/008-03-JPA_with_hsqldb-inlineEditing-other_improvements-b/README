In this USE CASE (008), STAGE (03) and SUB-STAGE (b) I 
implemented miscellaneous, usability improvements 
on the status of the previous STAGE (03).

Mostly moving from row to row (in a circular way) with
arrow keys and tracking the selected row with the cursor.

I've also confirmed with GD that <p:inputText>
doesn't work with filtering. Also, I built upon the
jQuery infrastructure provided from GD and managed to
provide a 'navigateWithArrows' implementation that doesn't
require any indices, only takes the event as argument.

The last bit of work I am working on right now is
utilizing jCaret to implement round-robin with the right/left
arrow keys.
