Experimenting with the scope
of various beans and methods to call one bean 
from another.

In this version, notice that the getters
don't get called in the RENDER-RESPONSE phase
unless the <p:commandButton>
tag contains an update for the panelGrid element
or Ajax is explicitly set to false (therefore,
Ajax is by default true).

Also notice that the constructor for BeanB
is called on every request, whereas the constructor
for BeanA only once. (Why should BeanB then be
serializable ?).

Finally, there seems to be no material
difference between using an 'action' tag at the
p:commandButton vs. using an 'actionListener' tag.

These last two points I should investigate further
at home.
