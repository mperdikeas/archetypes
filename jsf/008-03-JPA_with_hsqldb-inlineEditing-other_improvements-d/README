In this USE CASE (008), STAGE (03) and SUB-STAGE (d) I 
managed to implement the following feature, on top
of sub-stage (c):

    Handle a master-detail hierarchy with keyboard navigation.


Important things to note:

[1] there exist very complex interelationships between the ajax=true or false
    set to buttons on cars.xhtml with the hooking functions at the <SCRIPT> element
    of cars.xhtml. For certain ajax requests we have to rerun the hooking functions.

[2] this sub-stage gave rise to the following bug-case:

    "XXX-01-JSF-failing-with-view-scoped-musterious-caching"

    .. and so I had to change the scope of the bean from 'View' to 'Request'.
    However ... (see next item)

[3] ... by changing the scope from view to request, the bean-kept Lists of
    tentatively erased beans are recreated as empty on each request, and thus,
    the functionality that allows one to store the changes and commit them
    in one go at the end of his work is broken.

However, the remaning issue [3] is not what I set out to do, and thus, I consider
this sub-stage now complete.

Things to do for next stages and sub-stages:

[a] verify that the javascript code works in the presence of more than 1 child types
[b] verify that the javascript code can be extended to more than 2 levels of depth.
    I.e. not just father-child, but father-child-grandchild
[c] implement (for intellectual curiosity mostly) the tentative delete functionality
[d] merge G. Dimitriadis changes in script.js
[e] store script.js as part of the repo.
