In this USE CASE (008), STAGE (03) and SUB-STAGE (d) I 
am trying to implement the following feature, on top
of sub-stage (c):

    Handle a master-detail hierarchy with keyboard navigation.


Note that are very complex interelationships between the ajax=true or false
set to buttons on cars.xhtml with the hooking functions at the <SCRIPT> element
of cars.xhtml. For certain ajax requests we have to rerun the hooking functions.
