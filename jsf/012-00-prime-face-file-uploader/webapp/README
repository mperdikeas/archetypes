In this USE CASE (012) and STAGE (00) I 
managed to implement a small file uploading
example using PrimeFaces together with the 
EJB3 bean that purportly provides the file-related
service (e.g. in a real example the FileConsumingService#consume
method could parse the file's data and insert the values
in the database).
