In this bug-case I stumbled upon (and resolved)
a bug related to the inability to properly select
from two datatables which display JPA entities collections
organized in a master-detail relationship.

To see the bug toggle the scope annotation on line 42
of class CarsCELVController. When it is @RequestScope the
log messages on the Server side show that the detail selected
is null (log message in line 97 of the above file).
When it is @ViewScoped both the master and the detail are
properly set.
