In this USE CASE (008), STAGE (03) and SUB-STAGE (f) I 
managed to implement the following improvement over the
previous SUB-STAGE (e):

[i] Simplify, and enhance at the same time, the javascript code so that 
it can be extended to more than 2 levels of depth. I.e. not just
father-child, but father-child-grandchild.

In future sub-stages I should aim to:

[a] merge G. Dimitriadis changes in script.js
[b] store script.js as part of the repo
[c] implement (for intellectual curiosity mostly) the tentative delete functionality.

Interestingly, I changed to bean's scope to ViewScope
and it didn't fail despite the comment to the contrary
on line 42 of class CarsCELVController. Perhaps I should
investigate that as well.
