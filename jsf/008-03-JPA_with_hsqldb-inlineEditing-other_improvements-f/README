In this USE CASE (008), STAGE (03) and SUB-STAGE (f) I 
am aiming to implement the following improvements over the
previous SUB-STAGE (e):

[a] verify that the javascript code can be extended to more than 2 levels of depth.
    I.e. not just father-child, but father-child-grandchild
[b] implement (for intellectual curiosity mostly) the tentative delete functionality
[c] merge G. Dimitriadis changes in script.js
[d] store script.js as part of the repo.
