Note: this USE CASE (015) draws (in STAGE 00) its provenance from
USE CASE (008) STAGE (03) SUB-STAGE f.

In this USE CASE (015) and STAGE (01) I aim to build
upon the state of the implementation at USE CASE (015)
and STAGE (00) by ensuring that focusable and non-focusable
navigation works for paginated tables as well.

In the future I should aim to:

[a] merge G. Dimitriadis changes (table.js) in script.js
[b] store script.js as part of the repo
[c] implement (for intellectual curiosity mostly) the tentative delete functionality.
[d] investigate the scope failure curiosity noted in 008-03-f.
