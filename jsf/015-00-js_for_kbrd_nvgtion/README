Note: this USE CASE (015) draws its provenance from
USE CASE (008) STAGE (03) SUB-STAGE f.

In this USE CASE (015) and STAGE (00) I am aiming to:
[i] streamline the script.js JavaScript to separate
    selection from focus logic with the goal of making
    it reusable where the p:dataTable is selectable
    but not focusable.

In the future I should aim to:

[a] merge G. Dimitriadis changes (table.js) in script.js
[b] store script.js as part of the repo
[c] implement (for intellectual curiosity mostly) the tentative delete functionality.
[d] investigate the scope failure curiosity noted in 008-03-f.
