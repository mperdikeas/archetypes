Note: this USE CASE (015) draws its provenance from
USE CASE (008) STAGE (03) SUB-STAGE f.

In this USE CASE (015) and STAGE (00) I initially aimed to:
[i] streamline the script.js JavaScript to separate
    selection from focus logic with the goal of making
    it reusable where the p:dataTable is selectable
    but not focusable.

But, I've reached the conclusion (see carsro.xhtml) that
this feature doesn't make any sense. Having focus somewhere
is necessary in order to have the concept of the 'current'
datatable / row. So I am giving up on this generalization,
at least for now.

UPDATE: I later re-opened the use case and started making
some improvements in the script.js file which allowed me 
to ascribe meaning to a default selection in case of
non-focusable datatables and to enable navigation, at
the top-level only, using CTRL + up / down arrows only.

And there the matter rests.

In the future I should aim to:

[a] merge G. Dimitriadis changes (table.js) in script.js
[b] store script.js as part of the repo
[c] implement (for intellectual curiosity mostly) the tentative delete functionality.
[d] investigate the scope failure curiosity noted in 008-03-f.
