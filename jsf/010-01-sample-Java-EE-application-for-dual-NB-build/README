In this USE CASE (010) and STAGE (01) I am trying
to implement a sample Java EE project that is build both
ways, Ant and NetBeans. I've done that before, only this
time I am using a more structured way (the project consists
of three sub-projects: foo-ejb, foo-client and foo-war, and 
not just two, and as such the NB "import EE project from existing sources"
cannot be used, instead, I am importing a free-form project.
