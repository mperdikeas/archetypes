In this USE CASE (008), STAGE (03) and SUB-STAGE (e) I 
managed to implement additional functinality on top of
sub-stage (d) to verify that the javascript code works in the
presence of more than 1 child types

Interestingly, I didn't have to change the script.js file
from the previous SUB-STAGE which proves that the script is 
resilient.

Things for future SUB-STAGES:

[a] verify that the javascript code can be extended to more than 2 levels of depth.
    I.e. not just father-child, but father-child-grandchild
[b] implement (for intellectual curiosity mostly) the tentative delete functionality
[c] merge G. Dimitriadis changes in script.js
[d] store script.js as part of the repo.
