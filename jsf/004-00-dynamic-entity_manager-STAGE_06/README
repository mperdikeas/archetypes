In this STAGE (06) we are for the first time able to 
showcase the use of dynamically accessed EJB3 beans
with different persistent contexts.
NB: in the following database table 

            Table "public.users"
   Column   |       Type        | Modifiers
------------+-------------------+-----------
 user_name  | character varying | not null
 jdbccoodrs | character varying | not null


The column "jdbccoords" is not actually storing the JDBC URL of the database
but rather the application (ear) name of the EJB3 application which embeds the
corresponding persistence context. I should have changed the name of the column
to disambiguate that but I am short on time.
