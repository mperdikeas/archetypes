In this USE CASE (013) and STAGE (00) I 
managed to implement a small file downloading
example using PrimeFaces together with an
EJB3 bean that provides the file-related
service by opening a file bundled with the jar
as a resource. Be careful to ensure that the
resource is copied in the distribution (see copy
lines in the build.xml for the EJB jar).
