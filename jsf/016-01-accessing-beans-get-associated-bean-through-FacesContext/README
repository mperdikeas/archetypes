Experimenting with the scope
of various beans and methods to call one bean 
from another.

In this version I used the FacesContext-based
method for getting associated beans:

I also demonstrated that the scope of the backing 
bean is immaterial. It is the scope of the associated
beans that counts. In my case the BackingBean is Request-Scoped
and the two beans BeanA and BeanB are View and Request-Scoped
respectively and behave differently on that basis.

Also notice that the constructor for BeanB
is called on every request, whereas the constructor
for BeanA only once. (Why should BeanB then be
serializable ?). I further investigated the matter
and saw that both BeanA and BeanB's classes definitions
can be changed to not implement Serializable and the
code seems to work (but maybe it fails under circumstances
I wasn't able to trigger).

Finally, there seems to be no material
difference between using an 'action' tag at the
p:commandButton vs. using an 'actionListener' tag.

These last two points I should investigate further
at home.
