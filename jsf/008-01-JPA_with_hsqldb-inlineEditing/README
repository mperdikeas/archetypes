In this use case (008) and stage (01) I managed
to allow inline editing and some arrow-key-based
navigation on the rows of the datatable but it is
rather heavy (because arrow-key selection happens
at server-side with hidden button) and, thus, unsatisfactory.
Also, creation of new row doesn't happen inline.
Ideas for future stages:
[1] client-side selection of row
[2] inline editing for new row creation.
