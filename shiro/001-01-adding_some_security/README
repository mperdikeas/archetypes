tutorial series in Shiro (from: http://www.brucephillips.name/blog/index.cfm/2009/4/5/An-Introduction-to-Ki-formerly-JSecurity--A-Beginners--Tutorial-Part-1)
(adapted cause they are available for Eclipse / Maven).

This stage is for Tutorial Part 2.
I've managed to implement authentication.
NB: the "nosecurity" that appears in the package name is a misnomer. I don't have time
to fix this right now but should be trivial.

Ideas for next stages:
[i]    implement the same using PrimeFaces
[ii]   implement the same using the latest Shiro lib (2.* instead of 1*)
[iii]  verify the utility or redundancy of ehcache.xml
[iv]   use the new mechanism for IniShiroFilter
[v]    understand how to register and lookup JNDI names in the "java:/comp/env" namespace.

(at the moment I don't know which direction to take).
