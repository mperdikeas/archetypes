The target in this series of use cases (SHIRO # 010)
is to implement a poor-man's SSO passing usernames
and passwords as URL parameters and ultimately 
relying on a MemCached cache to store the passwords
temporarily and so only provide a ticket to retrieve
the password from MemCached.

In this stage (SHIRO # 010 # 03) I am trying
to reproduce the functionality of stage (SHIRO # 010 # 02)
only this time using the LoginController and IndexController
(now renamed to 'LinkController') as part of the neurolib-war
library (jar). This was accomplished and this version works
with version 998 of neurolib-war.

Things to do for the next stage:
[  i]    check how to implement logic to log him
         out if he is trying to access the application
         from more than one session.
[ ii]    implement the hiding of the password in 
         a memory cache.
