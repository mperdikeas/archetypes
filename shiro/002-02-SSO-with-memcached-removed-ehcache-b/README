This is a petrified snapshot to exhibit an interesting
behavior. When an appopriately authorized user visits
the GetAllUsers page an Exception is thrown because
class User is not declared as java.io.Serializable.
Once this is changed (User implements Serializable)
we are faced with the horrendous LogManager problem.

Thing to chew on:
[1] it appears that Shiro does more than authentication/authorization
    and is also into session clustering which is a different beast
    I am beginning to understand.
[2] maybe it is a best practice that all servlet-container backing
    beans should be serializable.
