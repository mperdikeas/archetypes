In this use case (003) and stage (01) I managed to test Shiro's authorization
and authentication with a custom JDBC database. In particular, the database is
that designed and provided from YK for GAIA.

Ideas for future stages:
[1] establish that persistence.xml files are redundant and remove them
[2] use Shiro's hashed passwords
[3] use Shiro's hashed passwords with SALT
[4] add SSO on top of that and verify it's working.
