GOAL: Trying to provide my own subclass of AbstractLdapRealm
that will be using UnboundId to do LDAP authentication
and authorization against the OID (Oracle Internet Directory)
LDAP server they use at Neuropublic.


In this USE-CASE (008) and STAGE (006) I am trying
to implement a small web prototype using Shiro authenticating
and authorizing against an LDAP server.

Tasks for next stages:

[1] streamline the implementation of the Shiro LDAP library and de-clutter
    the interfaces.
[2] implement SSO.
