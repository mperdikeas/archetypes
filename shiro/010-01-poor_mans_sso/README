The target in this series of use cases (SHIRO # 010)
is to implement a poor-man's SSO passing usernames
and passwords as URL parameters and ultimately 
relying on a MemCached cache to store the passwords
temporarily and so only provide a ticket to retrieve
the password from MemCached.

In this stage (SHIRO # 010 # 01) I am aiming to 
display and test the functionality using two
different applications.
