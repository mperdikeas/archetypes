GOAL: Trying to provide my own subclass of AbstractLdapRealm
that will be using UnboundId to do LDAP authentication
and authorization against the OID (Oracle Internet Directory)
LDAP server they use at Neuropublic.


In this USE-CASE (008) and STAGE (004) I managed
to implement **authorization** using Shiro against OID LDAP server.

I also managed to navigate the groups hierarchy and to be able to recursively
reach all groups of a specific user DN.

Tasks for next stages:
[1] streamline the authorization implementation
[2] return a richer AuthorizationInfo object comprising both Roles and Permissions
    and distinguishing amongst themselves.
[3] upgrade it from a console-applicatoin to a Web application
[4] SSO
