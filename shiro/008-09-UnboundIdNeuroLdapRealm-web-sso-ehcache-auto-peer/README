GOAL: Trying to provide my own subclass of AbstractLdapRealm
that will be using UnboundId to do LDAP authentication
and authorization against the OID (Oracle Internet Directory)
LDAP server they use at Neuropublic.


In this USE-CASE (008) and STAGE (009) I should try
to implement SSO using Shiro authentication / authorization
against an LDAP server utilizing an out-of-the-box EhCache.
The setting should comprise three (3) instances whose
caches are synchronized using automatic peer discovery
as opposed to manual peer discovery. I should also test that
with deployment to the same JBoss Application Server as opposed
to two or three different JBoss Application Servers.

The sample also demonstrates use of a memcached deamon
(assumed to be running in the local machine, accessible
at the hardcoded port 11211 - see implementation of class
memcachedshirocachemanager.MemCachedCacheManager). This 2nd cache
however is only used for vertical application logic and is 
irrelevant to the authentication / authorization thing.


Tasks for next stages:

[1] streamline the implementation of the Shiro LDAP library, de-clutter
    the interfaces and move it in its own project, or maybe in mutil.
