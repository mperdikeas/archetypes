GOAL: Trying to provide my own subclass of AbstractLdapRealm
that will be using UnboundId to do LDAP authentication
and authorization against the OID (Oracle Internet Directory)
LDAP server they use at Neuropublic.


In this USE-CASE (008) and STAGE (008) I managed
to implement SSO using Shiro authentication / authorization
against an LDAP server utilizing an out-of-the-box EhCache.


Tasks for next stages:

[1] do the same, using the EhCache cache manager, for way more than
    2 application, using some method of EhCache peer discovery other
    than 'manual'.
[2] streamline the implementation of the Shiro LDAP library, de-clutter
    the interfaces and move it in its own project, or maybe in mutil.
