In this use case (003) and stage (03) I managed to expand upon the
previous stage (02) by:
(a) implementing salted hashed passwords, using a custom (not the Shiro-default) PasswordMatcher
(b) doing 1,000,000 iterations of SHA-256 with column-stored salt.

Ideas for future stages:
[1] add SSO on top of that and verify it's working.
[2] experiment with the default Shiro  / Crypt format.
