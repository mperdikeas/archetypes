Tutorial series in Shiro (from: http://www.brucephillips.name/blog/index.cfm/2009/4/5/An-Introduction-to-Ki-formerly-JSecurity--A-Beginners--Tutorial-Part-1)
(adapted cause they were initially available for Eclipse / Maven).

This stage is frozen for Tutorial Part 5. No new functionality is added - it's just
about migrating it to JSF/Prime Faces.

NB: the "nosecurity" that appears in the package name is a misnomer. I don't have time
to fix this right now but should be trivial.

Ideas for this, and possible, future stages or perhaps different use cases:
[i]    add row-level permission, if possible
[ii]   integrate with LDAP
[iii]  understand how to register and lookup JNDI names in the "java:/comp/env" namespace.
