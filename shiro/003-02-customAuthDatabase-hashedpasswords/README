In this use case (003) and stage (02) I expanded upon the
previous stage (01) by:
(a) implementing hashed passwords, using a custom (not the Shiro-default) PasswordMatcher
    that uses 1 iteration of SHA-256 with no salt.
(b) establishing that persistence.xml is indeed redundant in this setup and excluding
   it from the deployed artefact.

Ideas for future stages:
[3] use Shiro's hashed passwords with SALT
[4] add SSO on top of that and verify it's working.
