In this use case (003) and stage (02) I should try to expand upon the
previous stage (01) by implementing hashed passwords.

Ideas for this and future stages:
[1] establish that persistence.xml files are redundant and remove them
[2] use Shiro's hashed passwords
[3] use Shiro's hashed passwords with SALT
[4] add SSO on top of that and verify it's working.
