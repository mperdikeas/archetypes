GOAL: Trying to provide my own subclass of AbstractLdapRealm
that will be using UnboundId to do LDAP authentication
and authorization against the OID (Oracle Internet Directory)
LDAP server they use at Neuropublic.


In this USE-CASE (008) and STAGE (007) I am aiming
to implement SSO using Shiro authentication / authorization
against an LDAP server.

Tasks for next stages:

[1] streamline the implementation of the Shiro LDAP library, de-clutter
    the interfaces and move it in its own project, or maybe in mutil.
