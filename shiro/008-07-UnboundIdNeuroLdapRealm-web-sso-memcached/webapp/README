This web application authenticates and authorizes
the users against the Oracle Internet Directory LDAP server
that lives where indicated in the shiro.ini file.

The following users, groups and privilliges have been created in that LDAP:

user                  password
================================
mary                  bones1234
jack                  paranoid1
bill                  gatesfoo1
james                 the_king1

group                 child group                        comment
=============================================================================================================================
staff                 secure                             group 'staff'  has a child group ('secure') so it's a role.
secure                NONE                               group 'secure' has no child groups so it's a permission
cacher                can_cache                          group 'cacher' has a child group and so is a role.
admin                 can_cache                          group 'admin'  has a child group and so is a role.
user                  defaultChildlessPermission         group 'user'   has a child so it's a role according to our conventions.
can_cache             NONE                               group 'can_cache' is childless and so is a privillige.



The problem with this LDAP approach is that I don't have something like HSQLDB
where I can have the entire database inside the testcase with the DML script
to load it (I'll have to find something similar).
