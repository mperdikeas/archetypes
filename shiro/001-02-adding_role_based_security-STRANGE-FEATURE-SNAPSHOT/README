IN THIS SNAPSHOT we are exhibiting the following behavior:
although the area "/admin/..." is configured in the web.xml Shiro filters
as off-limits for authenticated users that don't have the 'admin' role,
redirection by the Servlet nevertheless succeeds because the Servlet
fails to check the users' role. Be that as it may shouldn't the filter
be activated when the user is directed in the admin/users.jsp page ?


tutorial series in Shiro (from: http://www.brucephillips.name/blog/index.cfm/2009/4/5/An-Introduction-to-Ki-formerly-JSecurity--A-Beginners--Tutorial-Part-1)
(adapted cause they were initially available for Eclipse / Maven).

This stage is for Tutorial Part 3.

NB: the "nosecurity" that appears in the package name is a misnomer. I don't have time
to fix this right now but should be trivial.

The goal is to implement role-based authorization and to also consider the following ideas:
[i]    implement the same using PrimeFaces
[ii]   implement the same using the latest Shiro lib (2.* instead of 1*)
[iii]  verify the utility or redundancy of ehcache.xml
[iv]   use the new mechanism for IniShiroFilter
[v]    understand how to register and lookup JNDI names in the "java:/comp/env" namespace.
