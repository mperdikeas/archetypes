In this use case I managed to implement Shiro CacheManager and Cache 
classes that use memcached instead of EhCache in an attempt
to circumvent the problem of EhCache USE CASE 007.

To my dual surprise:
[1] it worked smoothly without problems on the first try
[2] the same instability that's manifested in EhCache USE CASE 007
is to be found here as well, meaning the the LogManager problem (see 
links [i] and [ii])  has got definitely to do with serialization
and is not EhCache-related.

Next steps is to remove EhCache completely out of the configuration
so that I am definitely sure that:
(a) the SSO implementation is working on account of MemCached
(b) the LogManager problem is not triggered by the presence of EhCache.
