GOAL: Trying to provide my own subclass of AbstractLdapRealm
that will be using UnboundId to do LDAP authentication
and authorization against the OID (Oracle Internet Directory)
LDAP server they use at Neuropublic.


In this USE-CASE (008) and STAGE (010), the goal is 
to implement SSO using Shiro authentication / authorization
against an LDAP server utilizing an out-of-the-box EhCache 
with *automatic peer discovery*, based on multicast addresses
and deploy three EARs in the same JBoss AS (as opposed to three
different) to establish that there are no port conflicts.

The test setting comprises 1 JBoss AS instance
and three different EARs whose caches are
synchronized using automatic peer discovery.

The sample also demonstrates use of a memcached deamon
(assumed to be running in the local machine, accessible
at the hardcoded port 11211 - see implementation of class
memcachedshirocachemanager.MemCachedCacheManager). This 2nd cache
however is only used for vertical application logic and is 
irrelevant to the authentication / authorization thing.


Tasks for next stages:

[1] streamline the implementation of the Shiro LDAP library, de-clutter
    the interfaces and move it in its own project, or maybe in mutil.
