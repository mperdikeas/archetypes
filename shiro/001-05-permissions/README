Tutorial series in Shiro (from: http://www.brucephillips.name/blog/index.cfm/2009/4/5/An-Introduction-to-Ki-formerly-JSecurity--A-Beginners--Tutorial-Part-1)
(adapted cause they were initially available for Eclipse / Maven).

This stage is for Tutorial Part 5.

NB: the "nosecurity" that appears in the package name is a misnomer. I don't have time
to fix this right now but should be trivial.

In this stage I managed to implement role- and permissions-based security for Shiro.
I also fixed the buggy thingy that resulted in inability to deploy the EAR if the 
database wasn't up and running. It turned out I had to add a "hibernate-dialect" property
in my persistence.xml. Now the application can be deployed and started with the database
down, and the database can come up in the middle of a session.
Finally, I've established that subjects are definitely properly greeted with their 
principal's name in this stage.

Ideas for future stages:
[i]    implement the same using JSF / PrimeFaces
[ii]  understand how to register and lookup JNDI names in the "java:/comp/env" namespace.
