Tutorial series in Shiro (from: http://www.brucephillips.name/blog/index.cfm/2009/4/5/An-Introduction-to-Ki-formerly-JSecurity--A-Beginners--Tutorial-Part-1)
(adapted cause they were initially available for Eclipse / Maven).

This stage is for Tutorial Part 5.

NB: the "nosecurity" that appears in the package name is a misnomer. I don't have time
to fix this right now but should be trivial.

In this I am trying to implement role-based permissions in Shiro.

Ideas for this and possibly, future stages:
[i]    implement the same using JSF / PrimeFaces
[ii]   print a greeting with the subject's name (current a bug - doesn't work - hmm.. maybe I've fixed that)
[iii]  understand how to register and lookup JNDI names in the "java:/comp/env" namespace.
