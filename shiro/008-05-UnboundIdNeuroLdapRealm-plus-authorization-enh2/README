GOAL: Trying to provide my own subclass of AbstractLdapRealm
that will be using UnboundId to do LDAP authentication
and authorization against the OID (Oracle Internet Directory)
LDAP server they use at Neuropublic.


In this USE-CASE (008) and STAGE (005) I managed to
return a richer AuthorizationInfo object comprising both Roles
and Permissions and distinguishing amongst themselves.

Tasks for next stages:
[1] streamline the authorization implementation
[2] upgrade it from a console-application to a Web application
[3] SSO
