GOAL: Trying to provide my own subclass of AbstractLdapRealm
that will be using UnboundId to do LDAP authentication
and authorization against the OID (Oracle Internet Directory)
LDAP server they use at Neuropublic.


In this USE-CASE (008) and STAGE (003) I am
trying to implement **authorization** against 
OID LDAP server.

Tasks for next stages:
[1] SSO
