GOAL: Trying to provide my own subclass of AbstractLdapRealm
that will be using UnboundId to do LDAP authentication
and authorization against the OID (Oracle Internet Directory)
LDAP server they use at Neuropublic.


In this USE-CASE (008) and STAGE (001) I managed to use
INI file properties to configure my AuthorizingRealm
implementation and declare interface and default
implementation for the default LDAP connection factory.

Tasks for next stages:
[1] support principal preffix and RD attribute
[2] support authorization
[3] SSO
