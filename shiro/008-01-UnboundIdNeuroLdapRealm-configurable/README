GOAL: Trying to provide my own subclass of AbstractLdapRealm
that will be using UnboundId to do LDAP authentication
and authorization against the OID (Oracle Internet Directory)
LDAP server they use at Neuropublic.


In this USE-CASE (008) and STAGE (001) the immediate goal
is to use INI file properties to configure my
AuthorizingRealm implementation and maybe properly declare 
interface and default implementation for the default
LDAP connection factory.

Tasks for next stages:
[1] support authorization
[2] SSO
