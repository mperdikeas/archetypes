The target in this series of use cases (SHIRO # 010)
is to implement a poor-man's SSO passing usernames
and passwords as URL parameters and ultimately 
relying on a MemCached cache to store the passwords
temporarily and so only provide a ticket to retrieve
the password from MemCached.

In this stage (SHIRO # 010 # 04) I am trying
to reproduce the functionality of stage (SHIRO # 010 # 03)
but my ensuring that the datasource is configured only 
in one place. I.e. not in both shiro.ini and common-beans.xml.

This was accomplished albeit at a great cost (I had to copy-paste
the entire JdbcRealm method implementation inside my GaiaJdbcRealm
class so that I could insert a call to setup the datasource that
would be evaluated in FacesContext). This version works with
version 1005 of neuro-jsf-pilot-svn-stable.

Things to do for the next stage:
[  i]    check how to implement logic to log him
         out if he is trying to access the application
         from more than one session.
[ ii]    implement the hiding of the password in 
         a memory cache.
