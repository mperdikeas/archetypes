tutorial series in Shiro (from: http://www.brucephillips.name/blog/index.cfm/2009/4/5/An-Introduction-to-Ki-formerly-JSecurity--A-Beginners--Tutorial-Part-1)
(adapted cause they were initially available for Eclipse / Maven).

This stage is for Tutorial Part 3.

NB: the "nosecurity" that appears in the package name is a misnomer. I don't have time
to fix this right now but should be trivial.

In this step I MANAGED to copy the functionality of Tutorial Part 3 in the new Shiro 1_2
and get rid of the deprecated API for the IniShiroFilter (this required introducing
an additional shiro.ini file in WEB-INF/). I also established (by trial and error
and googling) that you cannot do a logical OR on roles. The way to achieve such 
functionality is by using permissions (the link to this information is pasted in the
shiro.ini file).

Ideas for this and possibly future stages:
[i]    implement the same using PrimeFaces
[ii]   understand how to register and lookup JNDI names in the "java:/comp/env" namespace.
[iii]  implement permissions
[iv]   move on to the Tutorial Part 4

(at this moment I don't know which path to choose).
