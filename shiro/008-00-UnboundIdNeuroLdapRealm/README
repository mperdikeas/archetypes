GOAL: Trying to provide my own subclass of AbstractLdapRealm
that will be using UnboundId to do LDAP authentication
and authorization against the OID (Oracle Internet Directory)
LDAP server they use at Neuropublic.


In this USE-CASE (008) and STAGE (000) I managed to 
implement my own class subclassing the Shiro AuthorizingRealm
class and using the UnboundId LDAP library to do ** authentication **
against the OID (Oracle Internet Directory) they have at
Neuropublic.

Tasks for next stages:
[1] use properties to configure my custom AuthorizingRealm implementation
[2] support authorization
[3] SSO
