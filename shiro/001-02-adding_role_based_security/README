tutorial series in Shiro (from: http://www.brucephillips.name/blog/index.cfm/2009/4/5/An-Introduction-to-Ki-formerly-JSecurity--A-Beginners--Tutorial-Part-1)
(adapted cause they were initially available for Eclipse / Maven).

This stage is for Tutorial Part 3.

NB: the "nosecurity" that appears in the package name is a misnomer. I don't have time
to fix this right now but should be trivial.

In this stage I managed to implement role-based authorization and I've gotten rid
of the ehcache.xml file while also configuring a memory cache for the Shiro security
manager. I 've also left behind me a petrified snapshot (001-02-adding_role_based_security-STRANGE-FEATURE-SNAPSHOT)
that exhibits an interesting behaviour (bordering on a bug or bad practice) - see the README.

Ideas for future stages:
[i]    implement the same using PrimeFaces
[ii]   implement the same using the latest Shiro lib (2.* instead of 1*)
[iii]   use the new mechanism for IniShiroFilter (related to [ii])
[iv]    understand how to register and lookup JNDI names in the "java:/comp/env" namespace.
