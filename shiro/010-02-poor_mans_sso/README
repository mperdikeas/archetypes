The target in this series of use cases (SHIRO # 010)
is to implement a poor-man's SSO passing usernames
and passwords as URL parameters and ultimately 
relying on a MemCached cache to store the passwords
temporarily and so only provide a ticket to retrieve
the password from MemCached.

In this stage (SHIRO # 010 # 02) I am trying
to ensure that the user is only logged once.

Things to do for the next stage:
[  i]    make sure that if the user is already
         logged in, he is not logged in again.
[ ii]    check how to implement logic to log him
         out if he is trying to access the application
         from more than one session.
[iii]    implement the hiding of the password in 
         a memory cache.
