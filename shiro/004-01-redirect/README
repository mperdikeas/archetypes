Simple redirect from initial login page to
Shiro authentication / authentication page
using URL parameters.

This USE-CASE (004) and STAGE (01) demo consists
of two applications deployed in two separate 
JBoss AS servers. One that serves as a login portal (app-login)
and the other one that provides the actual application (app-actual).

Shiro authentication / authorization takes place in the second
application (that's deployed using the 'deploy-to-jboss2' script).

The first application (that's deployed using a simple 'ant' in the
'app-login/webapp/' folder), simply redirects the browser to the
correct application URL based on the 'client' value entered in the
first web form. That means that the username and password travel
unencrypted as URL query parameters on the HTTP redirect.

Ideas for future stages:
[1] solve the security issue in the redirect
[2] think about potential cookie issues
[3] do not require a button click on the second page
    (the login page with the backing bean managed fields
    already set from the URL parameters)
[4] ideally the second (login) page should not display 
    at all, but immediately invoke the login action
    (perhaps I can use JavaScript for that). If it does
    display however, I need to find a way to use a proper
    password field for the password, and not just a
    <h:inputText> (see login.xhtml, line: 27).
