tutorial series in Shiro (from: http://www.brucephillips.name/blog/index.cfm/2009/4/5/An-Introduction-to-Ki-formerly-JSecurity--A-Beginners--Tutorial-Part-1)
(adapted cause they are available for Eclipse / Maven).

This stage is for Tutorial Part 1.
I have managed to adapt the tutorial from its native format (Maven / Jetty / Derby) to (Ant / JBoss AS / HSQLDB).
Next step is to move on and adapt part 2 of the tutorial that starts implementing Shiro stuff.
