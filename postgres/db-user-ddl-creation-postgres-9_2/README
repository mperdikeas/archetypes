I had to modify the pg_hba.conf file
to allow trust-based access to postgres user
(see mperdikeas.github.com/postgresql.html).

Also, looking at the output of postgresql status shows:

    sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql status
    9.1/main (port 5432): online
    9.2/main (port 5433): online

... therefore the scripts had to be updated to use port 5433 (for Postgresql 9.2)
