In this example I am doing a login against an Oracle LDAP server
using UnboundId and then am getting all users and all groups.
I also do so slightly more involved stuff like finding the groups
a user belongs to and the other users of those groups.

Ideas for next stages:
* check whether I can do Shiro authentication by implementing my own Shiro authentication class
* check whether I can do Shiro authorization by implementing my own Shiro authorization class
* SSO
