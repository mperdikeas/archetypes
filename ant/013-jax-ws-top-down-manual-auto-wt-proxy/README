This archetype demonstrates use of the JAX-WS `standard` toolchain (default `wsimport`)
for a SOAP top-down approach using both:
    * the automated way (`wsimport` and, eventually, the creation of JAXB types)
    * the manual way (SOAP directly on top of HTTP)

It also shows how to do the above with a proxy (for logging incoming and outgoing HTTP 
messages).

NB: this archetype has dependencies with jar artifacts in the ESAVO project so there
exist symlinks pointing out of this repo. No time to worry about *that* now.
