This is a fine example of an Ant build.xml script
that downloads, untars and attempts to execute an
external executable. In this particular instance 
it fails, however due to the executable in question
being a .NET on that has to be launched under MONO.
For this scenario I'll investigate the following
Ant task:

https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/antlibs/dotnet/trunk/src/main/org/apache/ant/dotnet/DotNetExecTask.java

Other than that this build script is operational.
