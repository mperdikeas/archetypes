This archetype exemplifies:

[1] use of an IVY file-system resolver
[2] use of an IVY chained resolver
[3] use of a dynamically selected ivysettings.xml file 
    (see attribute settingsRef in the call to the ivy:resolve
    target)
[4] ant target to clean IVY cache (ivy-clean-cache)

During development time you are supposed to be simply using the
default ant build targets. These end up calling <resolve-dev>.
Target <resolve-dev> uses a chained resolver so it will fetch
the file for you from Maven central if it is not locally found.

You are then supposed to take the artifacts that are brought / downloaded
from Maven central and place them in:

ivy-filesystem-resolver-repo/


Once your project builds, to ensure that you actually get everything
from the local repo use:

    $ ant ivy-clean-cache && ant clean && ant resolve-only-local

You should be able to test that the above incantation complains if
you remove a file from ivy-filesystem-resolver-repo/
