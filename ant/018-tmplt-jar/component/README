This test uses an advance Ant build.xml template that allows style reports
and JUnit tests to also be produced. More importantly it shows how to
use the JUnit Parameterized class for data-driven testing and my solution
to the problem of who to invoke the Parameterized execution of a test case
for a single data point (also here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/27386564/274677).
