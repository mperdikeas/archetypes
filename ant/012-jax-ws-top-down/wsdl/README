For an alternative that avoids having a hardcoded filesystem location in the generated
Java files look at the following project:

    ~/esac-rawdar/playground/trying-to-use-wsdl-00/wsdl/

Also, the above project demonstrates correct use of a catalog file (catalog.xml) that
ensures that during [wsimport] code-generation no schema file is fetched over the 
network.
